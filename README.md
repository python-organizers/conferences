# Python Conferences

Here is a list of Python Conferences around the world. The goal is to make it easier for **speakers, instructors, sponsors** to find your conference.

- If you would like to add a conference or tool, please [submit a pull request](https://github.com/python-organizers/conferences/pulls).
- If you are a conference organizer, we can give you direct access to the repository, but it is your responsibility to update your own event! [Open an issue](https://github.com/python-organizers/conferences/issues/new?template=request-for-access-as-a-conference-organizer.md) to add yourself to the repository.

:warning: This repository does not power www.pycon.org; to add an event to www.pycon.org, see [its official repository](https://github.com/PyCon/pycon.org#adding-your-pycon-to-the-website). See also https://github.com/python-organizers/resources.

## Event Metadata

Include machine readable metadata on the homepage of your conference website to make it easier for aggregators to add your event to their listings. Here is the most recent example in JSON-LD format. Please see https://github.com/python-organizers/conferences/issues/266 for details.
